## Weinert_acetylation & Weinert_succinylation:

Mouse liver acetylayion and succinylation data on mouse liver from :
Lysine Succinylation Is a Frequently Occurring Modification in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes and Extensively Overlaps with Acetylation

The NNF Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark

Note that in the paper they specifically note that the protein lists will be bias towards mitochondrial proteins as these are by far the most abundant in mouse Liver

## Tan_glutarylation:


Glutarylation data on mouse liver from:
Lysine Glutarylation Is a Protein Posttranslational Modification Regulated by SIRT5
Tan et al (2014) - Yingming Zhao, Matthew Hirschey, David Lombard (see next), Scott Pletcher
Too many authors and insitututions. Lots of previous publications regarding lysine acylation and below (malonylation)
including the first proteomic analyses of succinylation (not in mouse unfortunately though).

Again, mouse liver so mitochondrial bias expected.

# ID is PIP which causes lots of problems. This data has eneded up largely ignored. Need to convert to Uniprot ID. This resulta in loss of data.

## Cheng_succinylation
Quantitative succinylome analysis in the liver of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease rat model
Yang Cheng, Tianlu Hou, Jian Ping, Gaofeng Chen and Jianjie Chen

Columns:
Protein accession
Protein names
Succinylated Position
Score (MaxQuant)
Modified sequence
NAFLD/Contro Ratio(a)
First repeat (Yes/No)
Second repeat (Yes/No)

(a), not quantified means the  identified succinylated site can’t be quantified between NAFLD group and Control group, because of insufficient collection of reporter ions. 

Two technical repeats. We'll just use the peptides identified in both.
