This directory contains the raw data for determining lysine acylation sites. The following tables were downloaded:

## Weinert_acetylation & Weinert_succinylation:

Mouse liver acetylayion and succinylation data on mouse liver from :
Lysine Succinylation Is a Frequently Occurring Modification in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes and Extensively Overlaps with Acetylation
Brian T. Weinert, Christian Sch√∂lz, Sebastian A. Wagner, Vytautas Iesmantavicius, Dan Su, Jeremy A. Daniel, Chunaram Choudhary (2013)
The NNF Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark

Note that in the paper they specifically note that the protein lists will be bias towards mitochondrial proteins as these are by far the most abundant in mouse Liver

Table columns:
id	Unique identifier for this table
Proteins	Identifiers of all possible proteins this site is associated with.
Positions	The positions of the modifications in all possible protein amino acid sequences.
Protein	Identifier of the protein this peptide is associated with.
Position	The position of the modifications in the protein amino acid sequence.
Protein Names	Names of the proteins
Gene Names	Names of the genes
Fasta headers	Descriptions of proteins this peptide is associated with.
Localization prob	Probability that the site is correctly localized at the position in the peptide.
Sequence window	13 amino acid window (+/- 6 amino acids) surrounding the acetylation site.
PEP	Posterior Error Probability of the identification. This value essentially operates as a p-value, where smaller is more significant.
Score	The Andromeda score of the identification (higher is better).
Modified sequence	Sequence representation of the peptide including location(s) of modified amino acids.
acetyl (K) Probabilities	Sequence representation of the peptide including the probability of succinylation occuring at each lysine residue.
Charge	Charge state of the precursor ion.

## Tan_glutarylation:

Glutarylation data on mouse MEF from:
Lysine Glutarylation Is a Protein Posttranslational Modification Regulated by SIRT5
Tan et al (2014) - Yingming Zhao, Matthew Hirschey, David Lombard (see next), Scott Pletcher
Too many authors and insitututions to list but no overlap with above. However lots of previous publications regarding lysine acylation,
including the first proteomic analyses of succinylation and malonylation (neither in mouse unfortunately though).

Again, mouse liver so mitochondrial bias expected.

Need to convert Gene names to Uniprot ID. This will likely result in loss of data unfortunately.
